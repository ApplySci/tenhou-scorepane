# tenhou-scorepane

Scoring pane for tenhou

Plugin for Firefox, and Chrome (not yet tested) - load in debugging mode.

Shows details of last hand, on right-hand side of screen.

Just proof-of-concept, it's very brittle.

I haven't yet got a clean way to remove the room type ("4P E-only") from the middle of the pane
 
And it really doesn't like the screen being resized while tenhou is loaded.
